Let me check the options available for you. \n\nI found a couple of museums that might interest you. The first one is the National Museum of China. It's open from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, closed on Mondays. The second option is the Capital Museum, which is open from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, and it's also closed on Mondays.\n\nWould you like more details on either of these, or do you have a preference?\n\nIt seems there was a mix-up in the information provided. Let me correct that and give you the right options for museums in the eastern area of Cambridge.\n\nOne option is the Cambridge Museum of Technology, located at The Old Pumping Station, Cheddars Lane. It opens on Sunday from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. The entrance fee is 5 pounds. The ID for this museum is 14.\n\nWould you like more details on this museum, or is there anything else you need to know?"}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "chat-fe355065d4484acfae4a08c607250b0d", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "[{\"address\": \"The Old Pumping Station, Cheddars Lane\", \"area\": \"east\", \"entrance fee\": \"5 pounds\", \"id\": \"14\", \"location\": [52.21247, 0.15619], \"name\": \"Cambridge Museum of Technology\", \"openhours\": \"it opens on Sunday from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.\", \"phone\": \"01223368650\", \"postcode\": \"cb58ld\", \"pricerange\": \"expensive\", \"type\": \"museum\"}]", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": []}, "stop_reason": null}], "created": 1732564055, "model": "qwen2.5-72b-instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 140, "prompt_tokens": 3788, "total_tokens": 3928}, "prompt_logprobs": null, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-11-25 20:47:34.914632", "call_duration": "0:00:05.209233", "response": "[{\"address\": \"The Old Pumping Station, Cheddars Lane\", \"area\": \"east\", \"entrance fee\": \"5 pounds\", \"id\": \"14\", \"location\": [52.21247, 0.15619], \"name\": \"Cambridge Museum of Technology\", \"openhours\": \"it opens on Sunday from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.\", \"phone\": \"01223368650\", \"postcode\": \"cb58ld\", \"pricerange\": \"expensive\", \"type\": \"museum\"}]", "model_name": "qwen2.5-72b-instruct"}}}, {"timestamp": "2024-11-25T20:47:43.249666", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a customer who wants to make a booking.\n\nYou want to book an attraction.
