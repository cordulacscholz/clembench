	 The postcode for the Scott Polar Museum is cb21er. As for other museum options in the city centre, I found one more option that fits your request. I suggest you consider Emmanuel College, which is located on Saint Andrew's Street in the city centre. The college is open normally daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. except Easter term, and admission is free. You can contact them at 01223334200 for more information. The id of this college is 27.
