Can you find out what its open hours are and what the entrance fee is? That way, I can compare it to the Cambridge Museum of Technology and make a decision.\n\nI've checked again, but unfortunately, I don't have any information about the open hours or entrance fee for the Gallery at Twelve a High Street. I can only confirm that it's a museum in the east area with an id of 29. If you'd like, I can try to suggest other options or provide more information about the Cambridge Museum of Technology to help you make a decision."}}, {"from": "Player 2", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-25T09:05:59.913687", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "[{\"id\": \"29\", \"name\": \"Gallery at Twelve a High Street\", \"area\": \"east\", \"type\": \"museum\"}]"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-25T09:05:59.922385", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "json successfully parsed"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-25T09:05:59.922819", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "update game state"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-25T09:05:59.922983", "action": {"type": "Game state", "content": "updated game state: [{'address': '?', 'area': 'east', 'entrance fee': '5 pounds', 'id': '14', 'location': '?', 'name': 'Cambridge Museum of Technology', 'openhours': 'Sundays from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.', 'phone': '?', 'postcode': '?', 'pricerange': '?', 'type': 'museum'}, {'id': '29', 'name': 'Gallery at Twelve a High Street', 'area': 'east', 'type': 'museum'}]"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-11-25T09:05:59.923111", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "I've checked again, but unfortunately, I don't have any information about the open hours or entrance fee for the Gallery at Twelve a High Street.
